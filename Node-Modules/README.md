# Node-Modules
Node.js is a popular runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
It provides a number of built-in modules, which can be used to perform various tasks such as file system operations, networking, cryptography, and more. 

Here's a brief description of some of the most commonly used modules in Node.js:

fs - This module provides an interface for working with the file system. It allows you to read, write, and manipulate files and directories.

http - This module provides an HTTP server and client implementation, allowing you to create web servers, make HTTP requests, and handle incoming HTTP requests.

crypto - This module provides cryptographic functionality, such as hashing, encryption, and decryption.

path - This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

os - This module provides information about the operating system, such as CPU architecture, memory usage, and network interfaces.

events - This module provides an event-driven architecture, allowing you to create custom events and event listeners.

util - This module provides utility functions that are useful for working with JavaScript objects and functions, such as inheritance and debugging.

These are just a few of the many modules available in Node.js. There are many more modules available for specific use cases, such as working with databases, web sockets, and more.
