// The timers module in Node.js provides a way to schedule the execution of code in the future or at regular intervals. It includes functions like setTimeout() and setInterval() which allow you to run a piece of code after a certain delay or at regular intervals respectively.

    console.log('Delayed message after 1 second');
  }, 1000);
