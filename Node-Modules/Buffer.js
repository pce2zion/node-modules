// The Buffer module is a built-in module in Node.js that provides a way to handle and manipulate binary data, such as images, video, and network packets. It allows Node.js to work with raw data, which can be useful for tasks like reading and writing files, working with network protocols, and other low-level operations.

// In Node.js, the Buffer module is implemented using JavaScript Typed Arrays and is designed to provide a way to create and manipulate raw binary data.

// Here's an example of how to use the Buffer module in Node.js:

// create a new buffer with 8 bytes of data
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(8);

// write data to the buffer
buffer.writeUInt32LE(0xfeedface, 0);
buffer.writeUInt32LE(0xdeadc0de, 4);

// read data from the buffer
const data1 = buffer.readUInt32LE(0);
const data2 = buffer.readUInt32LE(4);

console.log(`Data 1: ${data1.toString(16)}`); // Data 1: feedface
console.log(`Data 2: ${data2.toString(16)}`); // Data 2: deadc0de
