// In Node.js, the built-in events module provides an event-driven programming infrastructure that allows objects to emit and listen to events. This module is based on the observer pattern, where an object (the emitter) maintains a list of its subscribers (the listeners) and notifies them when an event occurs.

// To use the events module, you first need to create an instance of the EventEmitter class. This class provides methods to emit events and to register and remove listeners for specific events. Here's an example:


const EventEmitter = require('events');

// create a new instance of the EventEmitter class
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// register a listener for the 'greet' event
myEmitter.on('greet', function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// emit the 'greet' event with the argument 'John'
myEmitter.emit('greet', 'John');
